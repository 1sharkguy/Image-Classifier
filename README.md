# Image-Classifier
Welcome to the Image Classifier Project repository! This project aims to develop an image classification model using machine learning techniques to accurately classify images into predefined categories. This README file will provide you with all the necessary information to understand, set up, and contribute to the project.
FeaturesPreprocessing of input images for model training.Training of deep learning models (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks) for image classification.Model evaluation and performance metrics calculation.Easy-to-use interface for classifying new images using the trained model.
