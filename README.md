# Image Classifier Project

## Introduction
This project is an image classifier built with TensorFlow. It's designed to classify images into happy and sad categories. This classifier utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNN) to accurately identify the content of an image.

## Features
- High accuracy image classification
- Supports two different classes/categories

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas

## Installation
To install the image classifier, follow these steps:

Linux/macOS/Windows:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/1sharkguy/Image-Classifier
cd ImageClassifer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To use the image classifier, follow these steps:

```bash
python classify.py --image <path_to_image>
```

Replace `<path_to_image>` with the path to the image you want to classify.
